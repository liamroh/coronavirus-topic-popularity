## Methodology

**Methodology**:

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Gathered a dataset of tweets related to the coronavirus from a specific date range.
   - Filtered the dataset to include only English tweets.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Tokenization, Stop Word Removal, Lemmatization, and Stemming.

3. **Keyword Analysis**:
   - Created a bag of words from the preprocessed data.
   - Filtered out tokens, keeping the 20 most frequent tokens.

4. **Topic Modeling**:
   - Utilized Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to discover topics within the data.
   - Identified dominant topics for each tweet.

5. **Statistical Analysis + Modeling**:
   - Conducted regression analysis to examine relationships between dominant topics and other variables, such as favorites and retweets.

6. **Alternate Regressions and Transforms**:
   - Explored power transformation of data.
